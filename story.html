She spends her days watching true crime films, reading forensic books, and studying unsolved murder cases online Her room is filled with murder boards, notes, and sketches‚Äîeven though she‚Äôs never worked a real case.

         One rainy evening, Mitraw visits an old, abandoned mansion on the edge of the forest‚Äîa place the locals call ‚Äúthe ghost palace.‚Äù While exploring, she uncovers a hidden underground chamber, and inside she finds 11 buried human skeletons. Each one arranged in a circle. Strangely, they are all female skeletons, wearing rusted 1930s jewelry.

The moment she touches the remains‚Äîshe has a psychic vision. She sees flashes of their deaths: torture, chains, screams, and one name echoing in her head‚ÄîMinson.

        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Mitraw investigates the history of the village. She finds that in 1931, a powerful and feared man named King Minson ruled over the area. He was a landlord, a tyrant. The 11 women she saw were real sisters, abused and eventually murdered by him in secret after they tried to expose him
        </p>
        <p>
            Local records say they "disappeared" in 1931‚Äîno one ever found their bodies. The town moved on, pretending it never happened.
Then Mitraw makes a shocking discovery: The souls of the 11 sisters reincarnated in 1976, all born on the same day, same time, in different places. Now, in 2025, they are all 25 years old.
